# Exercises for Section 1.6

### 1.6.1

For the block-structured C code below, indicate the values assigned to w, x, y, and z.
```
int w, x, y, z;
int i = 4; int j = 5;
{
  int j = 7;
  i = 6;
  w = i + j;
}
x = i + j;
{
  int i = 8;
  y = i + j;
}
z = i + j;
```

#### Answer

w = 13, x = 11, y = 13, z = 11.


### 1.6.2

Repeat Exercise 1.6.1 for the code below.
```
int w, x, y, z;
int i = 3; int j = 4;
{
  int i = 5;
  w = i + j;
}
x = i + j;
{
  int j = 6;
  i = 7;
  y = i + j;
}
z = i + j;
```

#### Answer

w = 9, x = 7, y = 13, z = 11.


### 1.6.3

For the block-structured code of Fig. 1.14, assuming the usual static scoping of
declarations, give the scope for each of the twelve declarations.

#### Answer
```
Block B1:
	declarations:  ->   scope
		w				B1-B3-B4
		x				B1-B2-B4
		y				B1-B5
		z				B1-B2-B5
Block B2:
	declarations:  ->   scope
		x				B2-B3
		z				B2
Block B3:
	declarations:  ->   scope
		w				B3
		x				B3
Block B4:
	declarations:  ->   scope
		w				B4
		x				B4
Block B5:
	declarations:  ->   scope
		y				B5
		z				B5
```

### 1.6.4

What is printed by the following C code?
```
#define a (x + 1)
int x = 2;
void b() { x = a; printf("%d\n", x); }
void c() { int x = 1; printf("%d\n", a); }
void main () { b(); c(); }
```
